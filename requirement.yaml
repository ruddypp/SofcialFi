# ============================================
# RESPONSIVE DESIGN
# ============================================
responsive:
  breakpoints:
    mobile: "< 640px"
    tablet: "640px - 1024px"
    desktop: "> 1024px"
  
  mobile_optimizations:
    - "Single column layout"
    - "Bottom navigation bar"
    - "Simplified petition cards (smaller images)"
    - "Drawer menu for filters"
    - "Full-screen modals"
  
  tablet_optimizations:
    - "Two-column grid for petitions"
    - "Sidebar remains visible"
  
  desktop_optimizations:
    - "Three-column grid for petitions"
    - "Fixed sidebar"
    - "Hover effects enabled"

# ============================================
# PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS
# ============================================
performance:
  - "Use Next.js Image component for IPFS images"
  - "Lazy load petition cards (react-intersection-observer)"
  - "Cache contract data with React Query"
  - "Optimize bundle size (tree-shaking)"
  - "Use skeleton loaders for better perceived performance"
  - "Debounce search input"
  - "Pagination for large lists (20 items per page)"

# ============================================
# ACCESSIBILITY
# ============================================
accessibility:
  - "Semantic HTML elements"
  - "ARIA labels for buttons and interactive elements"
  - "Keyboard navigation support"
  - "Focus indicators visible"
  - "Alt text for all images"
  - "Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards"
  - "Screen reader friendly"

# ============================================
# ADDITIONAL NOTES
# ============================================
notes:
  gasless_implementation:
    note: |
      All transactions are gasless for users using Panna SDK on Lisk Sepolia.
      UI should always show "Gas: $0" or "Gasless Transaction" to emphasize this benefit.
  
  real_time_updates:
    note: |
      Use polling or websocket to refresh petition data:
      - Signature count updates in real-time
      - Boost status changes
      - New petitions appear automatically
  
  wallet_integration:
    note: |
      RainbowKit provides:
      - Multi-wallet support (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
      - Network switching
      - Account switching
      - Disconnect functionality
  
  seo:
    note: |
      Add meta tags for each page:
      - Open Graph tags for social sharing
      - Twitter Card tags
      - Dynamic meta for petition detail pages

# ============================================
# PROMPT FOR BOLT.NEW
# ============================================
bolt_prompt: |
  Build a modern Web3 decentralized petition platform with the following requirements:
  
  **Core Features:**
  - Landing page with glassmorphism dark theme
  - User onboarding: Connect wallet → Mint Soulbound Token (SBT) → Get 1 CAMP token
  - Create petitions: Pay with CAMP token (free) OR 0.002 ETH
  - Sign petitions: One signature per wallet per petition (gasless)
  - Boost petitions: Creators pay 0.001 ETH to boost for 7 days
  - Sorting: Boosted petitions first (by boostPriority DESC), then by creation date
  
  **Tech Stack:**
  - Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS (dark glassmorphism design)
  - Wagmi + RainbowKit for Web3
  - Lisk Sepolia testnet (Chain ID: 4202)
  - All transactions are GASLESS (Panna SDK)
  
  **Smart Contracts:**
  Import from: src/contracts/contracts.json (contains addresses + ABIs for):
  - CampaignToken (ERC-20)
  - SoulboundMember (ERC-721, non-transferable)
  - PetitionPlatform (ERC-1155)
  
  **Key Rules:**
  - Only SBT holders can create/sign petitions
  - Creators CANNOT sign their own petitions
  - One signature per wallet per petition
  - Boost system: first-come-first-served priority
  - Images uploaded to IPFS (Pinata)
  
  **UI Components Needed:**
  - Header with wallet connect (RainbowKit)
  - Hero section with animated background
  - MintSBT card (if user has no SBT)
  - CreatePetition form (with IPFS upload)
  - PetitionCard (glassmorphic, with boost badge)
  - PetitionList (sorted correctly)
  - PetitionDetail page (with sign/boost buttons)
  - Dashboard (user's petitions + signatures)
  
  **Design:**
  - Dark mode only
  - Glassmorphism style (backdrop-blur, transparent cards, glowing borders)
  - Smooth animations (fade, slide, scale on hover)
  - Responsive (mobile-first)
  - Loading states + toast notifications
  
  Create a complete, production-ready app with all pages, components, and blockchain integration.
  Use the contract structure and logic exactly as specified in the YAML above.
